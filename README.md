The final project for this course required implementation of assigned data strucuture using application.

## ScapeGoat Trees

## Application

The application designed used image detection method using OCR to detect items and ingredients within food products to estimate carbon and water footprint.

## Background

Greenhouse emission is one the major crisis the world is facing at the moment caused by factors ranging from automotive, industrial machinery to agricultural practices. Therefore, and urgent demand for solution has risen. With this application we intend to help user identify the footprint consumption for their products and minimze it.
